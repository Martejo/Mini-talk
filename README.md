<h1 align="center">Client-Server Communication Project with UNIX Signals</h1>
<h2 align="center">mini-talk</h2>

<h3>Objectif</h3>
The project consists in developing a client-server communication application using exclusively UNIX signals for data exchange.  

The server must be able to receive and display character strings transmitted by the client.
<details>
  <summary>Key features</summary>

1. **Server and client**: Two distinct executables, named server and client.

2. **PID display**: The server displays its PID after launch.

3. **Data transmission**:
   
   -  The client sends a character string to the server using its PID. 
   - The server displays the string once it has been received in full.

4. **Multiple client management**: The server can receive data from several clients consecutively without restarting.

5. **Display speed**: The server must display strings quickly (e.g.: less than one second for 100 characters)

6. **Use of UNIX signals**: Communication is based on SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals.

  <summary>Bonus (Optional)</summary>

  **Acknowledgement of receipt**: The server sends a signal to the client to confirm receipt of the message.  
  **Unicode support**: Ability to handle Unicode characters.

  <summary>What are UNIX signals?</summary>  
  UNIX signals are a fundamental aspect of UNIX-like operating systems, including Linux, and serve as a method of communication between processes.

  <h3>Definition</h3>

**UNIX signals**:  
These are notifications sent to a process to let it know that a specific event has occurred.  
They are used to interrupt a process, to ask it to terminate, or to notify it of other system events.  
These are symbolic constants represented internally by numerical values, usually integers.  
Each signal in a UNIX system has an associated number that represents it.  
These numbers are used by the operating system to identify different types of signal.

**For exemple**:
 - SIGKILL is often represented by the number 9.
 - SIGTERM is often number 15.
 - SIGINT is usually number 2.

These numbers are defined in system headers, such as <signal.h> in C.  
However, in programming and everyday use, signals are generally referred to by their symbolic names (such as SIGKILL, SIGTERM, etc.) rather than by their numbers.  
This makes the code more readable and less platform-dependent, as the exact numbers can vary between different implementations of UNIX systems.

When sending or handling signals in a program, these symbolic names are used, and the operating system translates these names into their corresponding numbers for internal processing.

<h3>Basic Functionaly</h3>  

**Sending Signals**:  
Signals can be sent by the operating system, by another process, or by the process itself.  

**Receiving signals**:  
When a process receives a signal, it can either take a predefined action, or define its own handler to respond to the signal.  

<h3>Signal types</h3>

**Standard signals**:  
For example, SIGKILL to force a process to terminate, SIGTERM to request the end of a process, SIGINT generated by the Ctrl+C shortcut, and SIGSTOP to temporarily stop a process.  

**Specific signals**:  
SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 are user signals that can be used for customized communications between processes.

<h3>Signal handling</h3>

**Signal handlers**:
Processes can define their own signal handlers to execute specific code in response to a signal.  

**Default actions**:  
Without custom handlers, signals have default actions, such as terminate, ignore or suspend.  A bit like the windows task manager.
